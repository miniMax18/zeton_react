# zeton_react

Zeton is an application that support behavioral therapy.
Token system for the child.
Allows you to earn points for your activities and exchange them for prizes.

## Application goals

- Developing deficit (desirable) behaviour
- Reduction of undesired behaviour
- Generating and maintaining therapy effects over time

## Development setup

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://...todo).

## Setup node environment

To install dependencies, run:

### `npm install`

## Available Scripts

To list every command, run: `npm run`

In the project directory, you can run:


### `npm run dev`
or
### `npm start`
or
### `npm run start`


Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

after that if we want to up in browser from dist:

### `npm run preview`

or if we want to get for that serve package:

### `npm run serve`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment)-->[this is legacy for change!!! to Vite] for more information.

## Up Zeton_react app by Docker or Podman separated from zeton_full_stack option:

In cli like bash terminal, prompt one line of them below:
### `docker build -t react_vite_ts_image_start -f ./Dockerfile_18_vite_alpine_4`
### `podman build -t react_vite_ts_image_start -f ./Dockerfile_18_vite_alpine_4`

or one line of them below:
### `docker build -t react_vite_ts_image_start -f ./Dockerfile`
### `podman build -t react_vite_ts_image_start -f ./Dockerfile`

Next step in cli terminal one line of them below:
### `docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name app_react_vite_ts_container_start react_vite_ts_image_start`
### `podman run -d -p 3000:3000 --name app_react_vite_ts_container_start react_vite_ts_image_start`

Next step in browser We can launch view of our frontend app without backend by endpoint below:
### `http://localhost:3000`

Another useful prompt in cli to check our images or containers situation:
### `docker images`
### `docker ps`

## Project UI

For styling we use [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)

Install the package of styled-components in your project directory with:

`npm install --save styled-components`

---

## Store container

For keeping state we use [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).

<!-- Install Redux Toolkit in your project directory with:

`npm install @reduxjs/toolkit` -->

Next install Redux core library:

`npm install redux`

And..

`npm install react-redux`

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
